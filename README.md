# **Power Sound Do-er Desktop Application**

PSD is a desktop application that allows you to add a sound effect for when you plug your computer in or out of a power source.

PSD only uses wav sounds(cos what more do you want) for the sound effects.

# LIBRARIES USED
- wxWidgets(for the gui)
- SFML(for the sound)

# INSTALLATION
- Dowload the latest (release)zip file and extract it anywhere on your computer
- Run the exe file
- The file will start from the systems tray so check there and you should see it, click on it to open the main GUI
- You can go ahead and add some sounds
- I provided some effects in a folder called 'sound effects'
- then TRY IT OUT!

# WHAT TO NOTE
As of v1.0.0, its the first version and its not perfect in any way. It doesnt use a lot of resources when it start with the computer on startup and stays in the background, but when youre doing stuff like adding songs it tends to use a little bit of the memory. That will be fixed(hopefully) in later updates.
